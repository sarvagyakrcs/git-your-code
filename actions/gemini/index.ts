                - Start with a brief 1-2 sentence overview of the main changes
                - Focus on the business/user impact rather than technical details
                - Use present tense and active voice
    
            2. **Core Features** (‚ú® New Features)
                - List major new features or functionality additions

            4. **Dependencies** (üì¶ Dependencies)
                - List added or updated packages/libraries
                - Format: - Added/Updated [package_name]@[version]: [purpose]
                - Only include direct dependencies, not sub-dependencies
    
            5. **Infrastructure** (üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure)
                - List changes to configuration files, build setup, deployment
                - Format: - Modified [file]: [what changed and why]
                - Include changes to .gitignore, environment setup, etc.
    
            ## Example Output

            ## Guidelines for Writing
    
            1. **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language focused on the impact of changes
            2. **Completeness**: Include all significant changes but avoid minor details
            3. **Context**: Provide enough context to understand why changes were made
            4. **Consistency**: Follow the specified format and emojis for each section
            5. **Relevance**: Skip sections if there are no relevant changes to report
    
            ## Filtering Rules
    
            - Exclude changes to whitespace, formatting, or comments
            - Exclude auto-generated files (like lockfiles) unless specifically relevant
            - Exclude temporary or debug code changes
            - Focus on changes that affect functionality, performance, or user experience
